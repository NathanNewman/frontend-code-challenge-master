## About

This project is a frontend design skills challenge from Yodler. The frontend is designed
using React and communicates with a simple Node backend. The project includes a homepage,
user register form, and admin component.

## Installation

To run this project, you first need Node.js installed on your computer. Then you need to
download this repository. Next, in the terminal, you need to type 'npm install' with the
frontend-code-challenge-master directory. Finally, still within the terminal, you need to
go to the frontend directory and type 'npm install' again. Each npm install could take
several minutes.

## Running the App

To run this project, you need two terminal windows. One terminal window needs to be in the
frontend-code-challenge-master directory. Type 'npm start' within that directory to start
the backend server. The other terminal window needs to be within the frontend directory.
Type 'npm start' within that directory to start the frontend code. If the webpage does not
load automatically within within your web browser, go to 'http://localhost:3000/' within
your web browser.
